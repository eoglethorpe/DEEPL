For months, nearly all basic commodities have\\nbeen only sporadically available in most locations, and basic\\ncommodity prices in August were on average 26 per cent\\nhigher than before the crisis. The impact of price increases on\\nYemeni families is considerable, given that purchasing power\\nhas fallen substantially as livelihoods opportunities continue\\nto diminish or disappear.\\nAt the same time, Yemen is experiencing a severe liquidity crisis\\nin which people, traders and humanitarian partners struggle\\nto transfer cash into and around the country. As conflict\\nand import restrictions have persisted, lenders have become\\nincreasingly reluctant to offer letters of credit to Yemeni traders.\\nThis reluctance has reportedly grown since the Government’s\\ndecision in September to relocate the Central Bank of Yemen\\n(CBY) from Sana’a to Aden. These developments are having a\\npronounced impact on the ability to finance imports of food,\\nmedicine, and other critical supplies, compounding the effect\\nof direct import restrictions, as well as considerably restricting\\npeople’s ability to access cash.\\nDespite the liquidity crisis, minimal banking services remain\\navailable in many areas.
